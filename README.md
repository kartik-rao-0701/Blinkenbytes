## üß† Design Philosophy & Notes

- **Shift registers are used**: Specifically, the **Nexperia 74AHCT245PW** has been chosen for its high-speed performance and compatibility.
- Design is based on **thorough research and technical literature**.
- **No additional multiplexing or daisy-chaining**‚Äîthis is a **pure GPIO performance** build.
- Crafted for **minimal EMI**, **low signal latency**, and **mechanical robustness**.
