## 🧠 Design Philosophy & Notes

- **Shift registers are used**: Specifically, the **Nexperia 74AHCT245PW** has been chosen for its high-speed performance and compatibility.
- Design is based on **thorough research and technical literature**.
- **No additional multiplexing or daisy-chaining**—this is a **pure GPIO performance** build.
- Crafted for **minimal EMI**, **low signal latency**, and **mechanical robustness**.

## 📁 Design Files

- ✅ **EasyEDA and Altium Designer** files included
  - ⚠️ *Altium files are converted* and currently in **beta** — some traces or nets may require manual validation
- ✅ **Bill of Materials (BOM)** file included

---

## 🔌 Power & Connectivity

- **Power input:** USB-C (Recommended: 5V / 5A)
- **UART connection** supported over USB-C via CP2102N
- **HUB75 display power** routed through onboard connector
- **Audio amplifier** powered via dedicated **5V LDO rail**
