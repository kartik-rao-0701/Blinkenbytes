## 🔧 Key Features

- **ESP32-S3 module** (16MB Flash, 8MB PSRAM *recommended*)
- **Six-layer bare PCB** for enhanced signal stability and thermal performance
- **Onboard microSD card storage** for audio, image, and data assets
- **MAX98357AETE+T I2S Digital Audio Amplifier**
  - Supports up to **8Ω speakers**
  - High-fidelity sound via I2S interface
- **HUB75 LED Matrix Interface**
  - Onboard **HUB75 connector** (16 GPIOs)
  - Optimized for **64x32 and similar RGB matrix panels**
- **USB Type-C (USB 2.1, 16-pin)**
  - First-in-industry integration for **power + UART + expansion**
  - Supports fast prototyping and modern devices
- **UART Bridge using CP2102N-A02-GQFN28R**
  - Compliant with Silicon Labs specs
  - **Errata handled** and resolved
- **Signal Shifting using Nexperia 74AHCT245PW**
  - Shift-register-based level shifter
  - Converts ESP32’s 3.3V signals safely to 5V for HUB75
  - Ensures display stability and reduces ghosting
- **PSRAM Pin Optimization**
  - GPIOs mapped with care
  - ⚠️ *If you need internal PSRAM, remove or reconfigure conflicting components as marked in the schematic*

## 🧠 Design Philosophy & Notes

- **Shift registers are used**: Specifically, the **Nexperia 74AHCT245PW** has been chosen for its high-speed performance and compatibility.
- Design is based on **thorough research and technical literature**.
- **No additional multiplexing or daisy-chaining**—this is a **pure GPIO performance** build.
- Crafted for **minimal EMI**, **low signal latency**, and **mechanical robustness**.
